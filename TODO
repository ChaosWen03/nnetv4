DONE

	Soak test run overnight on Mac and Linux.

	Found server -> client offset problem with packet hash. Fixed.

	Run soak overnight on mac.

	Get windows build working and run testbed. Verify unit test passes.

	Get PS4 build working and run testbed. Verify unit test passes.

	Verify soak test passes on Win64,

	Fix nintendo platform mutex.

	Verify nintendo platform can build.

	Fix iOS platform mutex.

	Update SDK version in all build and testbed projects, rebuild and individually test each platform.

	Verify testbed runs on X1

	Verify testbed runs on PS4

	Disable the memory checks.

	Rebuild all binaries without memory checks.

	Complete simple, upgraded and complex client/server examples.

	Add client stats print out every 10 seconds to complex example.

	Server should not need to specify platform id of player. 

	That's creating work for the integrator!

	Platform should be passed up from client -> server during upgrade negotiation.

	Upgrade all example programs and documentation so far to use the simpler upgrade function without the platform id in it.

TODO

	Make sure all example servers print out the from address.

	----------------------------------------

	Sketch out "Reference" section of documentation. Find somewhere that has a template I can copy for documenting functions and args etc.

	----------------------------------------

	Wait for the backend to catch up to us and become 3.4.5 compatible.

	Make SDK 3.4.5 release.

	----------------------------------------

	Reach out to Cam@recroom.com (Rec Room).

	--------------------------------

	There must be a functional test to verify bandwidth limiting.

	(add counters for packets sent direct because over bandwidth limit, client -> server, server -> client. add tests for each case).

	Make sure that sending packets direct doesn't count towards bandwidth limit. Add a test for that.

	--------------------------------

	Add counters to verify next pings and pongs are working.

	--------------------------------

	Add counters to verify direct pings and pongs are working.

	--------------------------------

	Add counters to verify near relay ping and pong are working.

	--------------------------------

	^--- functional tests for each of the ping cases above.
