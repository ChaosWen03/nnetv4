	----------------------------------------

	Sketch out "Reference" section of documentation. Find somewhere that has a template I can copy for documenting functions and args etc.

	----------------------------------------

	Wait for the backend to catch up to us and become 3.4.5 compatible.

	Make SDK 3.4.5 release.

	----------------------------------------






























	--------------------------------

	There must be a functional test to verify bandwidth limiting.

	(add counters for packets sent direct because over bandwidth limit, client -> server, server -> client. add tests for each case).

	Make sure that sending packets direct doesn't count towards bandwidth limit. Add a test for that.

	--------------------------------

	Add counters to verify next pings and pongs are working.

	--------------------------------

	Add counters to verify direct pings and pongs are working.

	--------------------------------

	Add counters to verify near relay ping and pong are working.

	--------------------------------

	^--- functional tests for each of the ping cases above.
