CHANGES

4.0.0:

	Server init packet passes up the datacenter name as a string.

	Simplify stats from client -> server, eg. remove mean, min, max RTT.

	Session update packet now includes the SDK version in it.

	Fix wire packet calculations so they include the 8 byte packet hash.
	
	Don’t hash the whole packet, only hash the first 32 bytes to distinguish network next packets. This is much less CPU.

	Reduced bits for platform id serialization.

	Reduced bits for user flags serialization.

	Reduced bits for flags serialization.

	Removed “GetSignData” processing entirely.

	Removed some old code around a previous implementation of wakeup callback.

	Normalize all the backend and relay facing packet numbers so they don’t conflict 3.x in any way (assume relay will have to support both SDK 3 and SDK 4 packets for a while)

	Server retries resolving hostname every 5 - 10 minutes (randomized) if it fails to resolve the hostname. This way we don’t lose servers if they can’t to initialize the hostname until they get restarted.

	Session update packet now contains the server routing public key. This makes the session update self contained. Server backend no longer requires the server map to process a session update packet.

	Session data is now passed up in the session update request packet, and passed back down in the session update response packet. This makes the session update stateless. We no longer need a session map to store per-session data.

	Removed session flags (unused). Saves 1 byte in header, route token and continue token.
