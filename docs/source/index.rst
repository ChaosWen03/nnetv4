Network Next SDK
================


Introduction
------------

Network Next is the marketplace for premium network transit. 

Our technology monitors your player's network connection and runs bids on our marketplace to find routes across private networks.

When we find a route that meets your optimization requirements, the Network Next SDK steers traffic for that player across that route.

If at any point Network Next is down, our SDK simply falls back to the public internet, without any disruption to your players.
