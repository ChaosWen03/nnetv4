	Extend the soak test to run with global and per-client and per-server allocator contexts.

	Hooking up the allocator, I need to be able to use a mutex to make the allocator threadsafe.

	Unfortunately, this creates a chicken and egg situation, since the mutex create relies on the allocator.

	Clearly the mutex needs to be modified to not use allocation.

	Do this now, then expose a wrapper API that 

	Fixed. Now I have a mutex and thread safe allocator, plus the allocator has a map that tracks allocated and freed pointers.

	Next step is to have separate allocators per-client, server and global.

	Now get the linux build compiling against with the mutex changes.

	Run the soak test on linux.

	Pass over todos and fix.

	Make sure next_client_internal_t is POD. Fixes G++ warning.

TODO

	--------------------------------

	There must be a functional test to verify bandwidth limiting.

	(add counters for packets sent direct because over bandwidth limit, client -> server, server -> client. add tests for each case).

	Make sure that sending packets direct doesn't count towards bandwidth limit. Add a test for that.

	--------------------------------

	Add counters to verify next pings and pongs are working.

	--------------------------------

	Add counters to verify direct pings and pongs are working.

	--------------------------------

	Add counters to verify near relay ping and pong are working.

	--------------------------------

	^--- functional tests for each of the ping cases above.

	--------------------------------

	Get the win64 testbed up and running debug and release.

	Get the win64 soak test running inside the win64 testbed.

	Run soak test for 1 hr on windows.

	--------------------------------

	Get the soak test running on ps4.

	Run soak test for 1 hr on ps4.

	--------------------------------

	Get the soak test running on x1.

	Run soak test for 1 hr on x1.
