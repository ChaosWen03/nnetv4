	----------------------------------------

	The resend of the session update may be broken.

	Test the resend of session update and the resend for init update.

	----------------------------------------

	Fix up release with windows changes (zip)

	----------------------------------------

	Wait for the backend to catch up to us and become 3.4.5 compatible.

	--------------------------------

	There must be a functional test to verify bandwidth limiting.

	(add counters for packets sent direct because over bandwidth limit, client -> server, server -> client. add tests for each case).

	Make sure that sending packets direct doesn't count towards bandwidth limit. Add a test for that.

	--------------------------------

	Add counters to verify next pings and pongs are working.

	--------------------------------

	Add counters to verify direct pings and pongs are working.

	--------------------------------

	Add counters to verify near relay ping and pong are working.

	--------------------------------

	^--- functional tests for each of the ping cases above.

	--------------------------------

	Add encryption + signature support to Network Next. By doing this, we could help our customers avoid double signing/encrypting packets.
