Hosting in Bare Metal
=====================

Network Next supports many hosting providers.

Please contact us and let us know the locations where hosting your game *and* which provider you use at each location.

We'll get back to you with the corresponding datacenter string for you to set for each location you host servers.

You can do this via the environmnt variable NEXT_DATACENTER (recommended), or by passing it directly to *next_server_create*.
