	---------------------

	Retry should be much less aggressive, eg. 3 retries at 1 sec apart, 6 retries at then 0.5 sec, 12 retries 0.25 apart... give up. 22 total tries in 10 sec.

	---------------------

	We must be able to see when clients fallback to direct, eg. either a burst of "fallback to direct" packets
	that include the session id, *or* the client that falls back to direct continues to report to us every 10 secs,
	with fallback to direct set to true on their session update.

	---------------------

	Server init must upload the datacenter name as a string.

	It's *impossible* to debug customers setting an incorrect datacenter name otherwise :(

	---------------------

	If the server fails to initialize with network next, it currently gives up and that server goes into a direct only mode.

	This will cause problems if customers don't regularly reboot their servers, for example, if our server backend is down, those
	servers that start up in the time it is down will not report back to us, until they are restarted.

	Servers should instead retry to initialize with network next every 5 minutes if they are in direct only mode and network next is not disabled.

	---------------------

	We should cut down the amount of information uploaded to us from the SDK down significantly.

	Right now the SDK uploads a lot of stuff to the server, and then uploads even more stuff to us in the backend.

	In particular, we should cut out the min/max/mean for all the values, we know which values we need now.

	---------------------

	Perhaps having a server_backend that psyonix.networknext.com and v3.networknext.com points to, will help us weather
	the problem we have with them running an old SDK version that has too fast retries, and various issues.

	This way we could try more scalable stuff with newer customers (valve), eg. redis based server, session and veto maps.

	--------------------------------

	There must be a functional test to verify bandwidth limiting.

	(add counters for packets sent direct because over bandwidth limit, client -> server, server -> client. add tests for each case).

	Make sure that sending packets direct doesn't count towards bandwidth limit. Add a test for that.

	--------------------------------

	Add counters to verify next pings and pongs are working.

	--------------------------------

	Add counters to verify direct pings and pongs are working.

	--------------------------------

	Add counters to verify near relay ping and pong are working.

	--------------------------------

	^--- functional tests for each of the ping cases above.
