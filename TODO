DONE

	Simplify stats from client -> server, eg. remove mean, min, max RTT.

	Make session update packet self contained so it has the SDK version in it.

	Fix wire packet calculations so they include the 8 byte packet hash.

	Don't sign the whole packet, only sign the first 32 bytes. Much cheaper computationally.

	Server init packet should include datacenter name as a string.

TODO

	Uint64 platdorm id is ridiculously wasteful. Serialize it as an enum instead.

	Remove "GetSignData" processing entirely. Packets have 8 bytes signature at the end (or beginning?). Which is most convenient?

	Implement session data that is passed up in the session update request packet, and passed back down in the session update response packet.

	Server should try to resolve hostname and initialize every 5 - 10 minutes (randomized), if it cannot resolve or initialize. Otherwise, we run the risk of losing game servers forever until they are restarted.

	Normalize all the backend and relay facing packet numbers so they don't conflict 3.x in any way (assume relay will have to support both old and new packets for a while now).
